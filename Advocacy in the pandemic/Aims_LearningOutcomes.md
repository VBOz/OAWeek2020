# Advocacy during COVID-19 and beyond #
## Aims and Learning Outcomes ##
Through lockdowns, border closures, and the working from home phenomenon the need to be more creative in our approaches to advocating for our cause has never been more important. Join AOASG Director Ginny Barbour and Creative Commons Australia Global Network Council Representative Katya Henry for this workshop on effectively delivering your message in this rapidly changing environment.   
At the end of this workshop you will be able to:
- Plan an advocacy workshop
- Decide on your target audience
- Identify what resources you'll need
- Plan constructive follow up
- Identify how to look after yourself as an advocate
