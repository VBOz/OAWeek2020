## Intro
Wikidata is an enormous multidisciplinary, multilingual knowledgebase and has become a central hub of the open data ecosystem. Whereas Wikipedia is written in prose, Wikidata is written in simple statements of subject-relationship-object, forming a network of concepts currently standing at 90 million items connected up by well over a billion links. 
This workshop will interactively introduce the basics of writing to and reading from Wikidata - assuming zero coding knowledge. We will learn to read a wikidata item, and write a simple query to pull out some information from the whole database. We’ll then directly add and edit items in the database. Finally, we’ll look at some of the tools that can be used to do larger-scale and automated editing.
